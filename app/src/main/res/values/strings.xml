    <string name="first_stage">"During this stage, Alzheimer’s is not detectable and no memory problems or other symptoms of dementia are evident."</string>

    <string name="second_stage">"The senior may notice minor memory problems or lose things around the house, although not to the point where the memory loss can easily be distinguished from normal age-related memory loss. The person will still do well on memory tests and the disease is unlikely to be detected by loved ones or physicians."</string>

They typically can still bathe and toilet independently. They also usually still know their family members and some detail about their personal histories, especially their childhood and youth."</string>

    <string name="sixth_stage">"People with the sixth stage of Alzheimer’s need constant supervision and frequently require professional care. Symptoms include:\n\n- Confusion or unawareness of environment and surroundings.\n- Inability to recognize faces except for the closest friends and relatives.\n- Inability to remember most details of personal history.\n- Loss of bladder and bowel control.\n- Major personality changes and potential behavior problems.\n- The need for assistance with activities of daily living such as toileting and bathing.\n- Wandering"</string>

    <string name="seventh_stage">"Stage seven is the final stage of Alzheimer’s. Because the disease is a terminal illness, people in stage seven are nearing death. In stage seven of the disease, people lose the ability to communicate or respond to their environment. While they may still be able to utter words and phrases, they have no insight into their condition and need assistance with all activities of daily living. In the final stages of Alzheimer’s, people may lose their ability to swallow."</string>
